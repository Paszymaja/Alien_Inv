# Alien_Inv

Alien_Inv is a mix between shoot 'em up and space invaders made using **python_3.6** and **pygame**.

It is playable but still lack some of features I want to add. Thanks to the Object-oriented design it is easy to add more things.
Enemies are randomly generated so it is not perfectly balanced.


You have 3 lives/ships.
